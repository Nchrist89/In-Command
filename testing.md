## CONTENTS

Testing was carried out while building the project. I started off getting the basic structure for the quiz game created and firstly added the first question to the question box. Once I had this sorted I created a next button which I could click which would then populate the next question into the field. When that was done I followed on to having the answer buttons placed in each answer box. I tested this and selected next question which would then repopulate the answer boxes again. When I had the code correctly shuffling and assigning a correct answer value to the answer box with the correct answer in it. Further testing was done again ensuring that the correct answer was showing with a dataset value of correct.

With every additional function which was added into the process, I again tested the game and had to overcome a multitude of different bugs. From finding out certain variables which I thought were holding a particular value but were not and finding out more information about nodelist and the methods available to me with them I started to learn at a much deeper level about Javascript and was really starting to enjoy it and also the frustration of bug fixing and resolving the issue.

I have done the majority of testing through Chrome Developer Tools while building and once complete I played the game several times to confirm that it was performing as expected.

I have provided the link to friends and family who have enjoyed playing and provided feedback should there be any issues. Once issue which was raised and I spent a while trying to find out what I must have got wrong in my code and this was really worrying me, but after much testing I found out that it was actually the data provided by Open Trivia AI that was causing an issue. Not my code which was such a relief.

Most users have not said that they have encountered any other issue than the one above and have found it exciting and an addicting game which has been great for testing.
