## Credits

### Code used

All code is mine apart from certain functions but I have also completely changed them and adapted them to my project, I have as best as I can noted what parts are with assistance from AI in my comments. Again the leaderboard functions and code was all completed by AI to include the local storage leaderboard scores.

### Content

Content for the website has solely been created by myself, some content where indicted in my comments have been corrected with Gemini AI and sometimes also validation for code has been confirmed with SiderAI but I have written and changes most of the code apart from the entire leaderboard update code which has been a complete copy over because I could not get it working properly.

### Media

#### Images

* Each image on the website has been created by providing AI with prompts to produce the desired image needed for my content. I have a premium account with PromeAI so the images created using it are legally owned by myself.
