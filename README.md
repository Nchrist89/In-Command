## Introduction

In command has been the second website and first game I have created using Javascript. I had so much fun in building it and have learnt so much and about my love for Javascript. The end result of the project isn't exactly what I had originally planned but it's turned out even better after a decision mid-way to change the feel of the project. It originally felt very dull and I wanted it to have a more 80's style Bladerunner vibe to it which would also work with the idea that I originally had planned and the outcome I am extremely happy with.

I have given the link to many family and friends, all of which have enjoyed the game quite a lot and expressed their frustration at the difficulty but also the want to succeed and be victorious meaning it has been quite addictive and given the game some replayability which has kept a few entertained.

I was let down at the end when I realized in order to make an actual leaderboard I would need to create a server which could store the scores so unfortunately I have had to settle with local storage but other than that I am happy with it and will look to improve and add to it in the future.

## User Experience (UX)

**Initial Planning**

When deciding what I wanted to build for my second project, I had a lot of wild idea's and upon looking at how I would create these idea's using Javascript I quickly understood just how difficult they would all be and after looking at various idea's others had gone with, I decided that a quiz could enable me to go with the original idea I had planned but not in the way I had originally planned it. I felt I could make the quiz more interesting and build upon a standard quiz with consequences. A reason to build up correct answers and a question timer to have tension which after brainstorming for many hours, I had come up with what would be the idea behind 'In Command!'.

After running the idea past my father he suggested the name In command and this was a great Idea because the game was taking place on an old style computer (terminal) and would look like it was written in command prompt. Secondly you are a secret agent needing to take command of the situation and the computer and as the player you have the end result of taking command on the leaderboard. So there it was, In Command stuck as the name.

## Credits

### Code used

All code is mine apart from certain functions but I have also completely changed them and adapted them to my project, I have as best as I can noted what parts are with assistance from AI in my comments. Again the leaderboard functions and code was all completed by AI to include the local storage leaderboard scores.

### Content

Content for the website has solely been created by myself, some content where indicted in my comments have been corrected with Gemini AI and sometimes also validation for code has been confirmed with SiderAI but I have written and changes most of the code apart from the entire leaderboard update code which has been a complete copy over because I could not get it working properly.

### Media

#### Images

* Each image on the website has been created by providing AI with prompts to produce the desired image needed for my content. I have a premium account with PromeAI so the images created using it are legally owned by myself.
