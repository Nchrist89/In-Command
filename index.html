                <p>You are a deep cover agent who has been tasked to gain access into the enemy forces base while they are currently distracted under attack. As a last ditch effort to win the war, the enemy has triggered nuclear warheads aimed towards the allied forces. You have located an access terminal for the NCM (Nuclear Command Module). Hack the system being careful not to trigger the alarm and get caught. You need to act fast to complete the objective! Good luck!</p>
